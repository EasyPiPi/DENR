\arguments{
\item{transcripts}{a \link[GenomicRanges]{GRanges-class} object that must
contain a metadata column with a transcript id and may contain an additional
column with a gene id.}

\item{transcript_name_column}{A string that indicates which column in the
GRanges object contain the transcript names}

\item{gene_name_column}{A string that indicates which column in the
GRanges object contains the gene names (not required).}

\item{bin_size}{An integer, used to tile the gene region. Default is 250bp.}

\item{distance}{The distance within which two transcripts are
considered connected (must be at least bin size, defaults to bin size). The
smaller this value is the more efficiently the model can be fit. Only
increase this if you are masking large regions at the starts and ends of
genes.}

\item{mask_start_bins}{A numeric vertor with length two which giving the
number of bins should be masked near the start of a transcript. The first
integer is the number of bins will be masked inside the transcript, while
the second interger is the number outside the transcript. Default c(0, 0).}

\item{mask_end_bins}{A numeric vertor with length two which giving the
number of bins should be masked near the end of a transcript. The first
integer is the number of bins will be masked inside the transcript, while
the second interger is the number outside the transcript. Default c(0, 0).}

\item{bin_operation}{Three different modes to deal with decimals in the
transript model (due to partial overlap of the first or last exon and bins).
Either "ceiling", "floor", or "round" (default: "round").}

\item{add_mask}{A \code{\link[GenomicRanges]{GRanges-class}}
object records genomic regions being masked. If seqnames in add_mask are not
available in transcripts, entries associated with these seqnames will be removed.}

\item{add_mask_scale}{A logical value indicates if additional genomic regions
are masked, when these regions are partially overlapped with bins, whether to
scale the bins by the proportion of overlap, or set the bins to 0.
Default is FALSE, i.e., set the bins to 0.}
